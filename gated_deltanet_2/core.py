"""Gated Delta Rule-2 — training-time recurrence cores in JAX.

Implements the token mixer of Hatamizadeh, Choi, Kautz, "Gated DeltaNet-2:
Decoupling Erase and Write in Linear Attention" (arXiv:2605.22791).
Equation numbers below are cited as "main text / Appendix A" where the
equation appears in both.

The state S ∈ R^{dk×dv} is an associative memory mapping key directions to
value rows; the output reads it with the query, o_t = S_tᵀ q_t (Eq. 1).
Each token applies three edits (Eq. 10/29):

    S_r = (I − k_r e_rᵀ) Diag(α_r) S_{r−1} + k_r z_rᵀ,
    e_r = b_r ⊙ k_r,   z_r = w_r ⊙ v_r,   α_r = exp(g_r) ∈ (0,1]

  1. FORGET: Diag(α_r) shrinks each key-channel row (passive decay).
  2. ERASE:  −k_r e_rᵀ S removes what the memory returns along the gated
     read direction e_r; the erase gate b picks WHICH key channels.
  3. WRITE:  +k_r z_rᵀ inserts the gated value; the write gate w picks
     WHICH value channels.
The "-2" is the decoupling: classic (Gated) DeltaNet ties erase and write
to one scalar β_r; here b (key side) and w (value side) are independent
per-channel gates.

Six implementations of the same recurrence:

  _recurrent_single           token-by-token scan of Eq. 9/29. O(L·dk·dv),
                              trivially correct — the verification oracle.
  _chunkwise_single_faithful  chunkwise WY form exactly as printed in the
                              paper (Eqs. 18-25 / 30-44), including the
                              explicit inverse A = (I + T)^{-1}. Overflows
                              fp32 when a chunk's cumulative log-decay G
                              drops below ≈ −88 (it materializes exp(−G)).
  _chunkwise_single_stacked_RHS_solve
                              faithful + the solver optimization: Y and U
                              come from ONE triangular solve with stacked
                              RHS [Ē|Z] instead of the explicit inverse.
                              Same literal factors, same ≈ −88 overflow
                              limit — the baseline the optimized cores
                              below build on.
  _chunkwise_single_centered  same algebra with per-chunk exponent
                              centering: all within-chunk exponents are
                              shifted by c = G_C/2, which cancels exactly
                              in every product (they only consume
                              differences of G) and is re-attached against
                              S0 via diag(exp(c)). Doubles the safe range
                              to |G_C| ≈ 176; used by the public entry point.
  _chunkwise_single_pairwise  overflow-proof fallback: forms every decay
                              factor directly as exp(G_r − G_s) per
                              (r, s, channel) triple — all exponents ≤ 0,
                              so NO range limit — at the cost of a
                              [N, C, C, dk] intermediate (×C memory) and
                              einsums instead of matmuls for T and A_qk.
                              Use when gate values exceed the centered
                              core's range and chunk_size cannot shrink.
  _chunkwise_single_subchunking
                              middle ground (GLA-style secondary chunking):
                              T and A_qk are assembled from sub-blocks of
                              size c. Off-diagonal block pairs factor the
                              decay through the row-block's entry boundary
                              — both factors have exponents ≤ 0 — and stay
                              batched MATMULS; only the c×c diagonal blocks
                              use the pairwise form. NO range limit, with
                              memory overhead ×(C/c) instead of ×C.

Chunkwise idea (Sec. 3.3 / App. A): substituting S_r = Diag(γ_r) Ŝ_r with
γ_r = exp(Σ_{i≤r} g_i) removes the decay from the recurrence — Ŝ follows a
PURE delta rule whose C-step unroll is a product of rank-one corrections.
Stacking its residual rows ρ_r = z_r − ē_rᵀ Ŝ_{r−1} gives one unit
lower-triangular system (I + T) R = Z − Ē S0 (Eq. 39), solved by forward
substitution; the output and end-of-chunk state are then dense matmuls.
Only the cross-chunk state remains sequential.

Chunkwise WY form (Eqs. 18-25 / 30-44), written in the paper's literal
factors — the reference realization that _chunkwise_single_faithful
implements verbatim; the other cores compute the same quantities with
safer factorizations (see the strategy notes below):

--------- Optimization strategies ---------

Two independent optimizations distinguish the chunkwise cores.

(a) SOLVER. Y and U solve the SAME unit lower-triangular system
    (I + T) X = RHS with right-hand sides Ē and Z (Eqs. 45/46). The
    faithful core materializes the explicit inverse A = (I + T)^{-1} and
    multiplies twice, as the paper writes it; every other chunkwise core
    uses ONE forward substitution over the stacked RHS [Ē | Z] (_wy_solve)
    — fewer flops (a (dk+dv)-RHS solve replaces a C-RHS solve plus two
    matmuls), one less [C, C] intermediate, and better numerics than
    multiplying by an explicitly formed inverse.

(b) DECAY FACTORIZATION. Define the pairwise decay ratios

        D_rsc = exp(G_rc - G_sc) · 1[s ≤ r]   (pair (r, s), key channel c)

    — the only decay factors T and A_qk actually consume. Together with
    the tail/carry ratios exp(G_C − G_r) and exp(G_C), every one of them
    has exponent ≤ 0, so the exact math is overflow-free; overflow can
    only enter through HOW a core factorizes D_rsc into materialized
    tensors. The optimized cores differ in that choice:

_chunkwise_single_stacked_RHS_solve — (a) only; keeps the paper's literal
factors, so the ≈ 88 overflow limit remains:
    D_rsc  = exp(G_rc)·exp(-G_sc)     (the exp(-G) half still overflows)
    [Y|U]  = (I + T)^{-1} [Ē|Z]       (one solve, stacked RHS)

_chunkwise_single_centered — (a) + the faithful exp(G_r)·exp(-G_s) split
with exponents shifted by c = G_C/2 per channel (matmuls; range doubles
to |G_C| ~ 176):
    Gc     = G - G_C/2            (spans ±|G_C|/2, not [G_C, 0])
    delta  = exp(G_C/2) <= 1      (re-attaches the shift to S0)
    Kbar   = exp(-Gc) ⊙ K,   Ebar_c = exp(Gc) ⊙ (B ⊙ K),
    Qg_c   = exp(Gc) ⊙ Q
    D_rsc  = exp(Gc_rc)·exp(-Gc_sc) = exp(G_rc - G_sc)  (c cancels)
    T      = tril(Ebar_c Kbar^T, -1),   Aqk = tril(Qg_c Kbar^T)
    R      = U - Y (delta ⊙ S0),  O = Qg_c (delta ⊙ S0) + Aqk R
             (delta ⊙ S0 restores Y S0 and Qgamma S0 exactly)      Eq. 35, 24/44

_chunkwise_single_pairwise — (a) + every triple formed directly (einsums
over a [N, C, C, dk] tensor; no range limit, x C memory):
    D_rsc  = exp(G_rc - G_sc)·1[s≤r]   (mask BEFORE exp: anti-causal
             exponents are ≥ 0 and would give inf·0 = NaN after)
    T_rs   = Σ_c (B⊙K)_rc K_sc D_rsc,  s < r                       Eq. 21/34
    Aqk_rs = Σ_c Q_rc K_sc D_rsc,      s ≤ r                       Eq. 25/43
    Ebar, Qgamma, Ktail as in the shared form (exponents ≤ 0, safe)

_chunkwise_single_subchunking — (a) + M = C/c sub-blocks, decay factored
through each row-block's entry boundary B_i = G at the last position
before block i (matmul-dominated; no range limit, x C/c memory):
    off-diagonal (r in block i, s in block j < i):
        D_rsc = exp(G_rc - B_ic)·exp(B_ic - G_sc)   (s ≤ bnd ≤ r, so
                BOTH exponents ≤ 0; batched matmuls per row-block)
    diagonal (r, s in the same block):
        Grel  = G - B_i ≤ 0        (block-local log-decay)
        D_rsc = exp(Grel_rc - Grel_sc)·1[s≤r]   (pairwise form, but
                only over c×c blocks; B_i cancels in the difference)
    T, Aqk = off-diagonal blocks + scattered diagonal blocks       Eq. 21/34, 25/43

The hand-derived backward of Appendix B is intentionally not implemented:
jax.grad differentiates through solve_triangular and the elementwise gate
products and reconstructs exactly those vector-Jacobian products. A manual
backward is only needed for a fused Triton/Pallas kernel.

    one (which keeps the paper's explicit inverse verbatim).

    HOW Eq. 21/34 and Eq. 22/34 WORK. The chunk's residuals obey
    ρ_r = (z_r − ē_rᵀ S0) − Σ_{s<r} T_rs ρ_s (Eq. 38): before edit r can be
    applied, it must subtract its overlap T_rs with every EARLIER edit s it
    partially erases. Stacking the C rows turns that chain of corrections
    into one linear system, (I + T) R = Z − Ē S0 (Eq. 39). T is strictly
    lower triangular (causality), so I + T is unit lower-triangular and
    invertible by construction — Eq. 21/34 defines A = (I + T)^{-1}, and
    Eq. 22/34 pushes A onto the two S0-independent right-hand sides:
    Y = A Ē (erase side), U = A Z (write side), so that later
    R = U − Y S0 assembles the residuals for ANY chunk-entry state.

    HOW THE ROW RECURRENCES OF App. A.4 WORK. Expanding (I + T) Y = Ē and
    (I + T) U = Z row by row gives
        y_rᵀ = ē_rᵀ − Σ_{s<r} (ē_rᵀ k̄_s) y_sᵀ,      Eq. 45
        u_rᵀ = z_rᵀ − Σ_{s<r} (ē_rᵀ k̄_s) u_sᵀ,      Eq. 46
    i.e. row r starts from its own factor (ē_r or z_r) and subtracts each
    earlier, ALREADY-CORRECTED row s weighted by the overlap T_rs = ē_rᵀ k̄_s.
    Computing row 1, then row 2 from row 1, then row 3 from rows 1-2, ... is
    exactly forward substitution — solve_triangular below runs that C-step
    chain in one call. Both recurrences share the SAME coefficients T and
    differ only in the starting vectors, which is why one solve over the
    stacked RHS [Ē | Z] yields both auxiliaries at once (App. A.4: "the same
    WY inverse can be shared by the erase-side and write-side computations").

    The explicit inverse A is never materialized: that would cost a C-RHS
    solve plus two matmuls and is numerically worse than solving directly.
    Y and U are independent of S0 — that is what lets all chunks precompute
    them in parallel before the sequential scan.

    GLA-style middle ground between the centered and pairwise cores. The
    triangular solve, WY auxiliaries, and cross-chunk scan are unchanged at
    full chunk size C; only the construction of the decay-aware score
    matrices T (Eq. 21/34) and A_qk (Eq. 25/43) differs. Each chunk is split
    into M = C/c sub-blocks of size c, and the entry (r, s) is built by
    where the pair falls:

      * OFF-DIAGONAL block pair (row r in sub-block i, column s in an
        earlier sub-block j < i): factor the decay ratio through the
        row-block's entry boundary B_i = G at the last position before
        sub-block i,
            exp(G_r − G_s) = exp(G_r − B_i) · exp(B_i − G_s),
        and since s ≤ (boundary) ≤ r and G is non-increasing, BOTH
        exponents are ≤ 0 — each factor lies in (0, 1], so these blocks are
        ordinary batched matmuls with no overflow at any decay strength.
      * DIAGONAL block (r, s in the same sub-block): the boundary trick
        cannot help (no boundary between them), so use the pairwise
        log-space form exp(G_r − G_s) per (r, s, channel) triple — but only
        over c×c blocks, a [N, M, c, c, dk] intermediate (×c memory)
        instead of the pairwise core's [N, C, C, dk] (×C).

    Result: NO decay-range limit (like the pairwise core), matmul-dominated
    compute (like the centered core), memory overhead ×(C/c) on the
    rescaled-key tensor + ×c on the diagonal blocks. This is the
    block-decomposition production Triton/CUDA kernels use.
