"""Gated NoPE Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) — the FULL-attention token mixer
of our Kimi K3 recreation.

In the K3 hybrid (inherited from Kimi Linear), 1 of every 4 layers is ordinary
softmax attention; this module is that layer:

  * MLA (DeepSeek-V2 lineage): keys/values live in a small shared low-rank LATENT,
    so the decode-time cache stores one latent vector per position instead of full
    K and V — the whole point of MLA is that tiny KV cache.
  * NoPE — NO positional encoding of any kind. The linear-attention layers (KDA
    in K3; GDN-2 here) already encode position implicitly through their
    recurrence, so the hybrid drops RoPE from its full-attention layers entirely
    (Kimi Linear Sec. 3.3, "NoPE"; K3 keeps the recipe).
  * Written in the ABSORBED form (see the class docstring): with no RoPE in the
    way, the K/V up-projections fold into the neighboring matrices exactly, so the
    latent itself serves as both K and V and never gets up-projected at runtime.
  * GATED MLA (Kimi K3: "Gated MLA improves attention selectivity"): a head-wise
    sigmoid output gate applied to the attention output right before the final
    (absorbed) output projection,

        o_gated = sigmoid(W_g x) ⊙ o

    This is the selectivity gate of the "Gated Attention" lineage
    (arXiv:2505.06708 — the input-conditioned, head-specific elementwise output
    gate Kimi K2 adopted, which suppresses attention sinks and massive
    activations). K3's exact gate formulation awaits its technical report; this
    is the lineage-faithful reading of the blog's description. Behind the
    `gated` flag (the model config enables it by default via mla_gated).

Two paths, same math: `__call__` for full-sequence training (causal-masked matrix
attention) and `step` for streaming decode (append the new latent to a preallocated
cache, attend over it).

    This is NoPE (no rotary embeddings) Multi-head Latent Attention written in its
    matrix-absorbed form, fused with GQA-style KV-head sharing. Each of the three
    projections folds together two of the usual MLA matrices:

        w_q_uk : W_Q  . W_UK   -> queries are produced *directly* in the
                                  compressed K space, so they can dot against the
                                  latent without an explicit key up-projection.

                                  output projection in a single matmul.

    Key consequence: because there is no RoPE, W_UK and W_UV can be absorbed away
    *exactly*, and in the compressed latent space the keys and the values are the
    same tensor. That is why a single `l_kv` plays the role of BOTH K and V below.
